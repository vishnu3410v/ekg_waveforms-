# # 🫀 ekg_waveforms

**ekg_waveforms** is a modular Python toolkit for processing and visualizing ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. It enables conversion of `.dat` files to `.csv`, waveform plotting with R-peak and QRS complex annotations, normalization for clear visuals, and export to `.png`. Includes CLI interface and modular structure for easy extension.
